	Welcome to Breadstation!

<div class="font-size: small; text-align: center; font-color: red;">
	That's right, I changed the MOTD. Don't need links to the old country's patreon.

	This is a fork of the Goonstation codebase, and mostly I consider this to (right now at least) be a chill
	place to experiment and learn how the game works. Don't necessarily get <em>too</em> attached to the work you're doing this shift,
	because if the whole place blows up that just sounds like a win to me. (Obviously, don't be a dick, though.)
</div>

	<strong>No idea what you're doing?</strong> For now, check out the Goonstation Wiki's <a href="https://wiki.ss13.co/Getting_Started">Quickstart guide</a>, but be aware that
	we can't really speak for the content there. It can be a bit goony.
	<br>
	<strong>Questions?</strong> I'm sure you can ask just about anyone on here for help, though they might know just as little as you do.
	Try the <a href="byond://winset?command=adminhelp">adminhelp</a> if any admins are on at the moment.

	<h2>Rules</h2><br>
	The general rules are really "Don't be a dick", and I don't really think that it needs to be said but better safe than sorry; no slurs bigotry etc. and <em>no</em> Roleplay is <em>not</em> an excuse for it.
<div>
<div>
	Other than that; just have fun, be chill, make bombs, let monkeys loose everwhere, give them weapons and point them at the captain - the revolution starts with you!
